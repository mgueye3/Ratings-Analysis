# Ratings Analysis

## Description
This Python script processes and analyzes user ratings, providing the following functionalities:
1. **Counting occurrences of a specific rating.**
2. **Displaying a summary of rating frequencies.**
3. **Identifying users who gave the highest and lowest ratings.**

This project is useful for analyzing user feedback and understanding trends in data, making it a valuable skill for a **Software Development Apprentice**.

## Features
- Accepts user input to count a specific rating.
- Provides a summary of rating frequencies (1-5).
- Identifies users who gave the highest and lowest ratings.
- Implements **error handling** for invalid inputs.
- Uses **modular functions** for clarity and maintainability.

## How to Use
1. Run the script using Python.
2. Choose an option from the menu:
   - `1`: Count a specific rating.
   - `2`: Display the rating summary.
   - `3`: Identify highest and lowest raters.
   - `4`: Exit the program.

## Installation
